* This is a new release.
* The NOTE is as follows:

Found the following apparent object files/libraries:
  inst/obj/cube.obj inst/obj/cube_badmtl.obj
  tests/testthat/testdata/planet.obj
  tests/testthat/testdata/planet_wnormals.obj

These are not compiled object files but in fact 'Wavefront' OBJ 3D Scene Files.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
